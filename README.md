# LESG
LESG is a compact single-player survival action-adventure built in Unity. Set in a stylized low-poly landscape, each playthrough generates a new rolling terrain full of trees, hills and more. Youâ€™ll explore, gather resources, craft simple tools, all with one clear objective: kill a bear without dying. Fast to learn, LESG mixes calm exploration with tense fight moments.
